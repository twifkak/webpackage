Consume the index section\r\n1. Sort the exchanges by their response range offset\r\n1. Consume the other sections up till the responses section\r\n1. Discard the bytes until it reaches the first exchange in the sorted list\r\n1. Buffer the bytes until it reaches the end of the the first exchange\r\n1. The first exchange becomes ready for its use:\r\n  1. Parse its responses header CBOR map\r\n  1. Read its payload\r\n1. Append bytes to the buffer until it reaches the end of the next item.\r\n1. The second exchange becomes ready for its use.\r\n1. ...\r\n\r\nSince there may be overlap in the response exchange, we need to keep around the original responses section in the buffer (which probably will reside on memory), since they may theoretically be used more than 1 time in a different CBOR interpretation. It is non-trivial to compute the \"done\" part of the responses section which are not referenced in later exchanges to partially free the original responses bytes buffer.\r\n\r\n## Non-streaming consumption of the small bundles\r\nIf the entire bundle is guaranteed to be a valid CBOR, it will become very easy to consume small packages which will easily fit in memory. If efficiency is not an issue, you can feed the entire package to CBOR parser, and consume the exchanges without implementing the full parsing algorithm.\r\n\r\nFor example, @irori created [a live web demo of unbundler](\r\nhttps://bundle-load-test.surge.sh/) which assumes that the bundler output a CBOR array as response section.\r\n\r\n# Proposals\r\n- Specify the structure of the responses section\r\n  - A valid CBOR array? \r\n- An index section entry references the response via array index, not offset\r\n  - Enforces the start of the response is aligned to the start of the item in the responses CBOR array\r\n  - Can save an alignment assert in the parser\r\n- Require the responses section to be always after the index section"

    "body": "I suppose the latest draft of the -impl checkpoint basically follows the latest responses draft ('the main draft) with some gaps, so a typical workflow could be like to keep cherry-picking changes from the latest responses into the latest impl draft.  However there are some diffs that are only tracked by the impl checkpoint but not in the main draft, e.g. like https://github.com/WICG/webpackage/pull/155 (`MI` vs `MI-draft2`).  I can see the reason not to track this in the main draft, but I'm afraid tracking such changes that only exist in some branch but not in the master responses draft may become a bit cumbersome, especially if we start to have multiple of such diffs.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to avoid doing this but instead put some instructions for the implementors in the main draft? (This is something @jyasskin mentioned as a potential alternative in some of our offline chat)  Or could we have some special section in the ChangeLog in the main draft so that all we need to cherry-pick can be still found in the main draft?"

To workaround this, Chromium has an [internal testing API](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/991833) (available only in test runner) that overrides signature verification time.\r\n\r\nIn order to test Signed Exchange Loading in web-platform-tests, we need an interoperable way to override signature verification time. The preferred way is defining a [WebDriver extension](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-extension-command) in the respective spec (in this case, Signed Exchange) so that the same surface API is used across UAs.\r\n\r\nSee [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zlFRcKuTM3RpoYjcOtiVOioRErEkJyCyv8hDs9_mlXo/edit#heading=h.n0pzm6uk5f69) for more details and discussions."

Additionally, there may be other use cases where \"internal only\" package contents might be needed and beneficial.\r\n\r\nIf that seems out of scope for this sort of bundling, though, no worries. Just wanted to check. 😃 \r\n\r\nWe'll be exploring that need in the Publishing WG via https://github.com/w3c/pwpub/issues/24\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n🎩 "

The first use needs to be similar to [`<link rel=preload>`](https://w3c.github.io/preload/#link-type-preload) so that it's not revalidated during that first use.\r\n1. Subsequent uses can either [update signature validity](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses.html#updating-validity) if the signature's expired, or use a conditional request if the cache information's expired.

(In particular, to withhold new content, and present old content as if it were fresh.)\r\n\r\nWith current browsers, when a user clicks on a link, if a page subsequently loads and `https://news.example.com/` is shown in the URL bar, they can be confident that the browser is displaying content retrieved from `news.example.com` and that was retrieved *after* they clicked on the link.  (That is, the content is fresh.) However, this is not necessarily true if the resource in question is a signed webpackage delivered by a CDN: whilst the content was signed by `news.example.com`, it could be up to 7 days old.\r\n\r\nThis may result in unexpected behavior for users in regions where the use of such CDNs/caches is pervasive (for e.g. performance and/or regulatory reasons) and where the cache operator has the ability and desire to selectively censor information (perhaps in reaction to a particular event or crisis). \r\n\r\nIf the cache rewrites links, it may even be possible to arrange for an entire website to appear up to date and completely functional when in fact fresh content is mixed with old at the discretion of the intermediary.\r\n\r\nSome mechanisms that may help reduce these risks:\r\n\r\n- Clients could indicate to users that content was not retrieved from an intermediary, and not the origin, and recommend that the \"reload\" feature be used if users are unsure of its freshness. (This also requires that the reload feature applies to the user-visible URL, and not the network URL; is this a recommendation of the format?)\r\n- Clients could verify the `validityUrl` more frequently than required, or allow users to manually trigger a validity check. (Related to [6.3 Downgrades](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses.html#rfc.section.6.3).)\r\n- Recommend that origins who believe they might be subject to such attacks expire signatures within seconds or minutes. (Perhaps this could vary per cache, depending on the degree of confidence the origin has in the cache.)\r\n- Recommend that origins embed absolute timestamps within their content (e.g. \"Last modified: 2018-03-15 18:45\"), so that users are aware when content is not fresh."

    "body": "For DoS reasons, the low-level portions of the networking stack must never buffer memory unboundedly. That means the Digest option is not usable, unless we move the hash check to the higher-level portions, but integrity is handled in the low-level portions. This means the low-level portions must return data with a \"this is unchecked, please check it later\". This is a classic mistake in designing a crypto system. All in all, this means that it is unlikely that any implementation of Digest could pass muster in Chrome.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, adding random redundant options is generally a bad idea. There's no reason to offer Digest when MI suffices. Please remove Digest from the specification completely."

    "body": "@davidben points out that it's hard to write streaming parsers, and that the most reliable protocols send a number of bytes to read, read that number of bytes, and then use a non-streaming parser to pull information out of that contiguous data. The format in https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses-03#section-5.3 doesn't accomplish this because CBOR items are prefixed by their length in items, not bytes.\r\n\r\nIn multi-process clients, we also want to allow the main/verification process to bound the amount of memory it uses. This implies (1) a length limit on the exchange header set, and (2) mandating use of the MI header instead of the Digest header to verify the payload authenticity, since MI has fixed-size records.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would be nice to be able to check signatures against the literal bytes in the http-exchange format instead of needing to reserialize. Reserialization still needs to be *possible* so that intermediates can receive a signature in a normal same-origin HTTP response and then produce the http-exchange format, but final clients shouldn't need to do it.\r\n\r\nThis probably means the format will move away from being a general http-exchange serialization format and toward being specific to signed exchanges. This has the extra benefit of not needing to say that request payloads and response trailers cause the signature not to verify."

    "body": "As a developer, it would be useful to be able to read what resources are in my own bundle.\r\n\r\nUse case example: I am writing a offline capable Zine webapp. I typically have a directory for each issue, and a number of html files in each directory corresponding to pages in my Zine. There is also a \"zine browser\" main interface that let's me pick which zine I want to read, or skip to pages, and the main interface knows what I was last reading. To let people share my zine, I create a webpackage of the client software, and a number of zine issues.\r\n\r\nDilemma: how does my main interface know what zines are available in the bundle?\r\n\r\nIdeally, as a developer, I could have the main-client reader able to ask- what resources do I already know about? Any zines in a webpackage ought to be able to present themselves to my main client, let it know: hey, there's content here.\r\n\r\nThis issue gets more pointed if users start collecting multiple webpackages, like if I release a new webpackage with new zines. Before- considering the case of only a single webpackage of main-client+zines- it would perhaps not be pleasant but it could be possible to build an index file into my webpackage that enumerates all the content. However when there are multiple webpackages available, it becomes outright impossible to work with this situation. The main-client will not have a way to figure out what is in other bundles.\r\n\r\nAn implementation of #107 would resolve this use case. If webpackage content were available via the page's Cache APIs then we could use `Cache.keys()` to discover the content.\r\n\r\nThere is a related problem in HTTP/2 PUSH, with not being able to detect content: whatwg/fetch#65. As a page, there's no way to detect resources that HTTP/2 PUSH has sent: once again the developer needs to create an out-of-band mechanism to ever be able to access the resource.\r\n\r\nI would like to see listing of at least same-origin content added to the use-cases. I hope this example of a Zine illustrates the need and how this capability would help. Thanks."

Although [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is a separate tool in concerns of responsibilities from webpackage, I've already had a variety of confusion expressed from our userbase about what webpackage is and how it relates to webpack. \r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe some options: \r\n* WebParcel\r\n* WebZip\r\n* WebDistro\r\n\r\nMind you these are off the cuff, but I'd like to formally spin up the work involved to start exploring a replacement if there are no objections.

    "body": "Several days ago, the [W3C Publishing WG published three working drafts][Publishing WG announcement], including [Packaged Web Publications][] (WPub/PWP), which defines a packaging format for combining collections of resources into a single portable WPUB file.\r\n\r\nThis WPub standard seem to be quite similar to this WICG–IETF Web Packages (WPK) standard. But the relationship between the two is unclear.\r\n\r\nI could find some references to the Publishing WG here. [Web Packaging Format’s use-cases note has a “Packaged Web Publications”][] in its “Nice-to-have” section; it refers to the Publishing WG and discusses several abstract use cases provided by the WG, without actual reference to WPub as a specification. Several issues here (#3 “Relationship to DPUB”, #32 “Document Adobe’s use cases”, #37 “Add a list of goals and non-goals”, #71 “Start an internet-draft”) also refer to the Publishing WG. Some Publishing WG members (@lrosenthol, @iherman, @dauwhe)  have participated in these issues.\r\n\r\nNone of these references talk about WPub as a separate specification, and none of them elaborate on its relationship with Web Packaging Format. Neither the [Web Packaging specification itself][] nor the [obsolete TAG Packaging on the Web draft](https://w3ctag.github.io/packaging-on-the-web/) make any mention of WPub either.\r\n\r\nThis is triply confusing. There is clear overlap between the two specifications’ use cases. For instance, both initiatives appear to desire addressing Google AMP’s use cases. Even their names are confusingly similar (WPK vs. PWP). Both are being actively developed—there were even announcements regarding both on this same week (the [WPub public-draft announcement][Publishing WG announcement] and the [Google AMP Project’s announcement on its transition to WPK][WPK for Google AMP]). And some of the same people have participated in both discussions on one standard and discussions on the other.\r\n\r\nFor readers of both specifications, it would be useful if their authors clarified this uncertainty. “What is the relationship between the two standards?” “Why are there two separate standards?” “How are their use cases and file formats similar and different?” Further active collaboration between the two specs’ authors might also be worth pursuing. Though it might be too late for unification, it would be a shame if there was fragmentation of the same goal into two formats. Browser vendors are probably less likely to implement two formats than just one. On the other hand, if their use cases are irreconcilable, then that should be made explicit in the specifications.\r\n\r\n(Also cf. https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/5#issuecomment-314265230, https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/5#issuecomment-315076651 by @HadrienGardeur; as well as w3c/wpub#10, w3c/wpub#90, and w3c/wpub#111.)\r\n\r\n[Publishing WG announcement]: https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/6756\r\n\r\n[Packaged Web Publications]: https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-pwpub-20180104\r\n\r\n[Web Packaging Format’s use-cases note has a “Packaged Web Publications”]: https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-webpackage-use-cases.html#rfc.section.2.2.1\r\n\r\n[Web Packaging specification itself]: https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-dispatch-web-packaging.html\r\n\r\n[obsolete TAG Packaging on the Web draft]: https://w3ctag.github.io/packaging-on-the-web/\r\n\r\n[WPK for Google AMP]: https://amphtml.wordpress.com/2018/01/09/improving-urls-for-amp-pages/amp/\r\n  "

This is loaded from a version-specific URL, say packages.jquery.com/v3-2-1, to ensure that A's app is running with the right version of jQuery or python that it was developed for. However, A has to trust the integrity of B and B's server to actually keep the resource static. B or any attacker on B's server has the power to inject malicious code into A's web app. This makes shared libraries impractical for security-critical applications. \r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, A links B's package with both a URL and a hash, which is checked by the client as soon as B's package is loaded (libraries are unlikely to need streaming). So A can have absolute confidence that their app uses the exact same version of the resource that it has been developed for, while keeping the benefits of shared library use.\r\n  "

One of these documents was the original packaging on the web which has since been obsoleted by your work. However there are many open issues on our document and before we summarily closed them we wanted to alert you to these issues in case you wanted to bring any of them over into your issues list. Can you please have a look through [these issues](https://github.com/w3ctag/packaging-on-the-web/issues) and leave a note on each issue to let us know that it's OK to close it? If you do take one of them on as an issue, please leave a note including a link to your new issue.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDan Appelquist\r\nCo-Chair, W3CTAG"

For example, instead of allowing arbitrary `RevocationInfoChoice`s, we might specify that the `SignedData.crls` field be filled with exactly one OCSP response. The result could still be parsed with CMS tools, but it could also be parsed with much simpler package-specific tools.\r\n\r\nI suspect we'll run into some trouble around the `SignerInfo.*algorithm` fields: the current format specifies exactly one digest+signature algorithm for each possible certificate type, and doesn't encode that algorithm into the serialized bytes. CMS appears to allow the attacker to select the algorithms, just like [JOSE](https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/). A package-specific parser would enforce the restriction, but a generic CMS tool wouldn't, and so would be vulnerable to the same attacks as JOSE. That's a reason to use a non-CMS format, to disallow generic tools from parsing package signatures."

    "body": "The sketch, which I've run by @sleevi, is:\r\n1. Check the manifest's signature and that the signing certificate is for the package's claimed origin and that it chains to a trusted root, using intermediate certificates included in the package.\r\n2. Each package also has an accompanying set of OCSP responses and anti-downgrade information.\r\n3. The UA checks that the OCSP responses are signed by the certificate's signer and were generated less than 7 days ago.\r\n4. The UA checks that the anti-downgrade information is signed by a certificate trusted for package's origin (potentially taking advantage of the package's intermediate certs), hasn't expired yet and was signed less than 7 days ago, and says that the package's date is sufficiently recent.\r\n5. If any of this isn't recent enough, the package identifies a URL from which to fetch newer validity information. This validity information is small (<1kb?), so it should be cheap enough to fetch even when full packages are too expensive.\r\n\r\nThere's some evidence that we'll still have a significant number of UAs that are fully offline and won't be able to fetch new validity information every week. Depending on the existing HTTP cache's behavior, maybe we don't need to revalidate once we've opened a package once. Maybe it's ok to trust older validations as long as the package doesn't make any network requests, and have revalidation block the package's first network request when the UA gets back online. We'll need to decide what to do about local storage if that validation fails.\r\n\r\nI need to add this to the main explainer."

    "body": "I received feedback from some of our security people that [DER](https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/languages/X.690-0207.pdf) is easier to parse securely than [CBOR](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049). I'm not 100% sure that's the right choice yet, so here are some pros and cons.\r\n\r\nDER Pro's:\r\n1. Much older, with security-hardened implementations in many languages. e.g. BoringSSL includes a library for memory-safe DER parsing. CBOR has [many implementations](http://cbor.io/impls.html), but they aren't hardened.\r\n1. Prefixing with the length in bytes makes it easier to skip unneeded items. CBOR can work around this by embedding things into bytestrings.\r\n1. Generic parsing has only 2 cases: Primitive, where the interpretation of the bytes depends on the tag, and Constructed, where the content bytes encode a sequence of items. CBOR has 8 cases: integer, string, array, map, tag, simple value, simple value in next byte, and float. This is primarily used to skip unknown fields in structures.\r\n\r\nCBOR Pro's:\r\n1. ~8 primitive types instead of 30+. We can subset ASN.1 to only use INTEGER, OCTET STRING, UTF8String, and SEQUENCE, but we can also subset CBOR to use integers, byte strings, text strings, arrays, and maps.\r\n1. Extensibility based on maps from strings to values is easier to understand and possibly to manage than ASN.1's extensibility based on appending to sequences. However, it's possible I've missed a better way to extend structures in ASN.1.\r\n1. It's easy to find the latest specification.\r\n1. Combining the length into the type saves a byte for smaller items.\r\n1. Serializing canonical CBOR, which is needed for signature checking, is significantly easier to implement.\r\n1. All DER integers and floats have to deal with the complexity of encoding bignums. For our purposes, where bignums aren't needed, CBOR's 8,16,32, and 64-bit integers are simpler. Even if bignums were needed, it's likely that a fixed length would be simpler to specify and implement than DER's variable-length encoding.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we stick with CBOR, we'll mandate [Canonical CBOR](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#section-3.9), which includes minimal integer encodings. That means offsets will need to measure a range that doesn't include the offset itself, but that's doable for both the section list and the resource index.\r\n\r\nI'll update this list as more considerations come up."

URLs can be fairly long, so we may want to optimize or compress that redundancy.\r\n\r\nOne idea for avoiding this duplication: Add a section of abbreviations that assigns each resource-key an index, and use those indices as the keys in the other three sections.\r\n\r\n1. We could re-use the index as that section of abbreviations.\r\n2. We probably don't want to re-use the manifest as that section, so that aggregating packages can build their own abbreviations.\r\n3. The abbreviations need to be expanded before hashing or checking signatures.\r\n4. We could shorten the abbreviation section even more by:\r\n   1. Resolving each URL/resource-key relative to the previous one.\r\n   1. Using the array index of the URL as its abbreviation instead of making the section name an abbreviation.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility would be to use a shared brotli dictionary to compress all three sections. The main downside here is that shared brotli dictionaries don't exist yet, and when they do, we may want to use a URL to identify which shared dictionary to use, which we'd again want to compress."

We think it makes sense to switch to 100% binary format since the header compression and parts body compression makes it mostly binary anyways. It also lets us to replace MIME boundary strings with direct chunk-size kind of encoding.\r\n2. The Explainer and samples in it will be gradually updated to reflect switch to binary encoding. While in update, there can be some inconsistency in the doc.\r\n\r\nAlso discussed:\r\n- Binary alignment at 32 bit boundaries (decided not to)\r\n- Use Self-Delimiting Numeric Values (rfc 6256) (decided not to)\r\n- Split content index and offset table (so the resources may be rearranged)\r\n- Multiple hashes (to support deprecation of old ones)\r\n- Cross-signing\r\n"

    "body": "Hi all, I saw some of you at Blink On, and I promised to come up with a few user stories. Rather than trying help shape the implementation, I thought I could just outline why electron is looking at this format. Here's my first pass at some user stories.\r\n\r\n## App Installer Story\r\n\r\nDeveloper Kim builds a new electron app, and wants to host it on her site. She wants to make the install as easy as possible, and a new hot installation tool some people have downloaded knows how to take a web package, and install it like a desktop app. Right now, every electron app comes with its own chromium. A web package format distribution could link out to the required chromium, which may already be installed on the users desktop.\r\n\r\nThe end-user downloads the `.electron` bundle, double-clicks it, and the installer installs a new app.\r\n\r\nBoth the installer, and the operating system should be validating the package and checking code signatures. (Open question if the dynamic installer messes up the signature story)\r\n\r\nA new icon is placed wherever there operating system installs applications, and double-clicking it opens the app.\r\n\r\n## Lifecycle with _shared_ resources\r\n\r\nKim is at it again, but this time her users have demanded an even slimmer after install experience. Kim builds the next web package bundle, but instead of including everything in `node_modules` the web package simply links out to indicate that a requires these and PM modules at specific versions. To complicate matters, some of these modules require compilation.\r\n\r\nKim knows that not all of her users have developer tools installed, but also doesn't want to set up CI on numerous different platforms. That's okay, we have your back. The top 100 electron modules that require compilation have been precompiled on common platforms packaged into a web package format.\r\n\r\nUser Angela downloads Kim's latest web package, which only includes the core app code. The installer understands the outbound links in the web package, and first attempts to satisfy them with a local cache on disk. One of the compiled dependencies is missing however, and the installer has to downloaded fresh. Instead of pulling from npm directly, the installer is able to resolve the location of a precompiled version and use that.\r\n\r\n## BigCorp\r\n\r\nBig Corp once control over every last bit of their installed application. They want to block every last piece down. They want a self-contained packaging format, where everything gets shipped altogether.\r\n\r\nThis is the situation we have now, which is why it's worth putting down.\r\n\r\n## BigCrop Internal\r\n\r\nInternally at big Corp, they have a lot of internal tools developers that wish to distribute quick one-off applications. Because everything is running behind their firewall, they only want vetted code. Developers love the hotlinking that the web package can do, but all links should resolve to an internal npm mirror and an internal blob store for precompiled modules."

These all work by having a directory at end of file, but for all use cases I know a pointer to start of archive on the tail would be sufficient. Doing so would most likely just be a series of magic bytes and kength that exists at the end of the file. It could be optional but must be easy to add to an existing webpackage.\r\n\r\nFor a signature of the entire binary + archive this is important so people don't perform a secondary concatenation and load a different archive than expected, it most likely can just be a well known header that optionally exists on the package headers."

You cannot create it entirely in stream, due to (a) the way that offsets are used and (b) the index file needing to list all other files.\r\n\r\nIf streaming is not a requirement for this format - that's fine.

We are also looking at Web App Manifest (https://w3c.github.io/manifest/) as a potential mechanism. Our goals are very similar, so it would be helpful to discuss and find common ground. "
